# üé∂ WaveChopper

WaveChopper is a full-stack audio manipulation application that allows users to upload `.wav` files, reorder and manipulate audio data, and manage their creations with a user-friendly interface. Users can register, log in, and save their customized audio files to their library for future access.

## üìå Project Overview

**What**:  
WaveChopper enables users to upload, edit, and save audio files, providing both a streamlined and powerful interface for audio manipulation and a secure environment for user data.

**Why**:  
This app is designed for those interested in experimenting with audio data. Whether you‚Äôre a music enthusiast, developer, or audio engineer, WaveChopper offers a unique platform to play with sound patterns.

**How**:  
The app uses the MERN stack for fast, scalable development and includes JWT authentication for user sessions. Audio data manipulation is handled with custom byte reordering algorithms in the backend.

## üöÄ Features

- **User Authentication**: Register and log in securely to access saved creations.
- **Audio Manipulation**: Upload `.wav` files and reorder audio bytes in creative ways.
- **Library of Creations**: Save, manage, and revisit your past audio manipulations.
- **Responsive Design**: Accessible across devices with a consistent UI experience.

## üìê Architecture and Flow

1. **Frontend (React)**: Users interact with the UI, uploading files, viewing their library, and managing account settings. React and Tailwind CSS are used to create a responsive design.
2. **Backend (Express & MongoDB)**: The backend handles file uploads, audio manipulation, and database interactions. It securely stores user data and references to uploaded files.
3. **Audio Processing**: Custom manipulation logic reorders the audio bytes as per user-selected patterns. Manipulated files are served back to the client for preview and download.

## üîí Authentication and Security

- **Password Hashing**: User passwords are hashed using bcrypt for secure storage.
- **JWT**: JSON Web Tokens are used for user sessions, providing a stateless and secure authentication system.
- **CORS**: Configured for allowed origins to prevent unauthorized cross-origin requests.
